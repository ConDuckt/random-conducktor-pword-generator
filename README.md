# NU-VIRT-FSF-PT-01-U-LOLC || Challenge 03 || JavaScript: Password Generator

# Random ConDucktor

## Description

This is the third challenge from my coding bootcamp, in which I implemented JS on a project for the first time.

The code works by setting up arrays for different character types and using Math.random to assign them to the generated password.

It works... in principle. While I was able to set it up so that 4 character types are selected via promp (per requirements), I was unable to get the password to conform to the length requirements. Also, the charactewr types are displayed in prompt order every time.

The aha! moment when I finally got my password variable to work/display was great, but as a Fraud specialist I would not advise anyone use this program for anything other than educational purposes.
